# CollectionLetter
Final Project For CS1302

This program works by reading from dataCollection.txt and reading each line of text, bringing it into a set of temporary strings, then placing them into a preset format, resembling a collection letter for a debt. The text file has 1000 different lines, so the program will create a new file for each "letter", resulting in 1000 letters for each specific customer.
